## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository provides a customizable OpenAI Gym-compatible environment designed for training and benchmarking reinforcement learning algorithms on optimal sensor placement problems in structural engineering.

The environment simulates dynamic structures (e.g., cantilever beams) and uses a reward function based on the eigenstructure of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to guide agents toward sensor configurations that maximize information gain.
